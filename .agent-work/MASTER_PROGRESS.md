# NEXORA OS — master execution progress

Last updated: 2026-11-10

## Overall status

- **Version 1.0 release-acceptance completion: 0%.** The repository's release checklist currently records zero accepted release tests. This is not a claim that no source code exists; it means no release acceptance item has been proven for a complete candidate.
- **Roadmap stages:** S00 baseline/recovery is complete. S01 build foundation is active. S02–S12 have not started.
- **Product release status:** NOT RELEASE-READY. No verified engineering ISO artifact is available from the latest build attempts.

## Current checkpoint

- **Current stage:** S01 — Ubuntu 26.04 AMD64 image foundation.
- **Current stage status:** IN PROGRESS.
- **Current task:** Remove the Ubuntu Resolute live-build Syslinux legacy-theme dependency without changing the Ubuntu 26.04 target; verify the resulting mode, suite, keyring, Casper initramfs, and target release in CI.
- **Execution branch:** `fix/snapshot-package-index-fallback`.
- **Open pull request:** [#5](https://github.com/ravaunrichards/NEXORA-OS-1.0/pull/5).
- **Last verified branch commit before this progress checkpoint:** `366d0ab2330725a55682906c01303b53815c526d`.
- **Last verified main commit:** `d8b2085122e094b514caf803921385d57ec435f7`.
- **Last completed action:** Inspected the repository tree, build scripts, installer config and CI evidence; confirmed PR #5 validation #159 passes and its ISO build #45 progresses beyond snapshot bootstrap but fails during the Syslinux stage.
- **Exact next action:** Implement and test a narrowly-scoped live-build compatibility configuration on this branch; trigger repository validation, the live-build probe and the full engineering ISO workflow.

## Stage register

| Stage | Title | Status | Verified outcome |
|---|---|---|---|
| S00 | Repository identity, recovery and execution records | COMPLETED | Exact repository, main baseline, active PR branch and commit/tree fingerprint recorded; five agent records committed. |
| S01 | Ubuntu 26.04 AMD64 image foundation | IN PROGRESS | Existing build pipeline and regression tests inspected. Snapshot index fallback is on PR #5 and CI validation passes. Full ISO build still fails on obsolete Ubuntu Syslinux theme packages. |
| S02 | Shared operating-system base and services | NOT STARTED | Plasma login, core devices and services require actual image testing. |
| S03 | NEXORA Classic desktop | NOT STARTED | No completed Classic shell or acceptance tests. |
| S04 | NEXORA Flow desktop | NOT STARTED | No completed Flow shell or acceptance tests. |
| S05 | Safe Calamares installation and desktop selection | NOT STARTED | Installer configuration exists; disk-writing acceptance remains unproven. |
| S06 | Welcome, settings, application and diagnostic centers | NOT STARTED | Functional implementations and integration tests remain. |
| S07 | Security, privacy, Secure Boot and encryption | NOT STARTED | Production policy, signing and LUKS acceptance remain. |
| S08 | Updates, backup and recovery | NOT STARTED | No proven update recovery or data restoration workflow. |
| S09 | Hardware, networking, accessibility and performance | NOT STARTED | Physical hardware matrix and performance evidence remain. |
| S10 | Gaming, creator, developer and specialist packs | NOT STARTED | Optional real package collections and compatibility verification remain. |
| S11 | System-wide QA, documentation and release qualification | NOT STARTED | Release acceptance checklist has zero accepted tests. |
| S12 | Governance and long-term maintenance | NOT STARTED | Branch protection, licensing and supply-chain controls remain open. |

## Tests and evidence

| Check | Result | Evidence / limitation |
|---|---|---|
| Repository identity and main branch | PASS | GitHub repository metadata and main branch ref verified. |
| Active branch identity | PASS | PR #5 head and parent inspected. |
| PR #5 repository validation | PASS | [Actions run #159](https://github.com/ravaunrichards/NEXORA-OS-1.0/actions/runs/42879056682), head `366d0ab2330725a55682906c01303b53815c526d`. |
| Calamares package/module probe on main | PASS | [Actions run #21](https://github.com/ravaunrichards/NEXORA-OS-1.0/actions/runs/42860436299); does not prove a disk installation. |
| Latest full ISO attempt on PR #5 | FAILED | [Actions run #45](https://github.com/ravaunrichards/NEXORA-OS-1.0/actions/runs/42879047899); obsolete `syslinux-themes-ubuntu-oneiric` and `gfxboot-theme-ubuntu` unavailable. No ISO produced. |
| Synthetic ISO boot-structure tests | PASS (synthetic only) | Existing CI evidence records BIOS/UEFI El Torito entries and hybrid EFI partition; not a real NEXORA ISO boot. |
| BIOS/UEFI QEMU boot of a NEXORA ISO | NOT RUN / NOT PASSED | Boot workflow was skipped after ISO build failure. |
| Local Git status and local tests | UNAVAILABLE | No local checkout; clone blocked by DNS resolution. |

## Errors discovered and disposition

1. Snapshot Packages index objects intermittently failed from the pinned snapshot endpoint. PR #5 adds same-relative-path transport fallback while preserving signed snapshot metadata and debootstrap checksum/size verification. Its targeted repository validation passes; its full ISO result is not yet successful.
2. The next full-build blocker is the live-build Ubuntu-mode Syslinux theme path requesting obsolete Oneiric theme and gfxboot packages. A correction must preserve Ubuntu Resolute package metadata, keyring trust and Casper live boot; it is not accepted until CI proves the configured target remains Ubuntu and a full ISO is generated.
3. The prior build failures involving `nouveau-firmware` and the removed memtest filename have code-level regressions/tests, but the newest full build has not yet reached or revalidated all downstream stages.

## Outstanding defects and dependencies

- S01: Resolve Syslinux integration, generate a real ISO, verify hybrid structure/checksum, then pass all BIOS/UEFI optical/USB QEMU tests.
- S02–S10: Product capabilities listed in STAGE_QUEUE.md are unimplemented or unverified.
- S11: No end-to-end release evidence; no production release.
- S12: Main branch protection is not enabled; no project license has been selected.
- Environment: No local checkout is mounted; local commands cannot be executed here.

## Last successfully completed action

Repository identity and existing state were checked, and the agent execution/progress records were created on the existing PR branch without changing `main`.

## Exact next action

On the same active branch, update the live-build compatibility configuration and regression/probe coverage, then validate the commit through GitHub Actions. Keep S01 IN PROGRESS until full ISO generation and QEMU boot evidence pass.
